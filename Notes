1. Once you created the server and then listen it then it means it is available for the incoming requests.
2. package.json : Contains Configuration of your project. It stores critical metadata about a project.
3. node_modules : It contains all the source code of express js here. It contains all the packages and subpackages on which express depends.
4. dependency : Any package without your project not run is known as dependency.
5. version : express '^4.19.0' [^(carot):If any new version comes in 4.0.0 series then it autmatically update to new version, 4:Major Fix and it might not backward compatible, 19:Minor feature release and it is backward compatible, 0:It is patch for bug fix and it is backward compatible.]
6. package_lock.json : The package-lock.json is a lockfile that holds information about the dependencies or packages installed for a node.js project, including their exact version numbers.
7. nodemon : Automatically refresh and restart the server.
8. .gitignore : This file contains name of all the files and directories that we don't want to push on github.
9. Note : We don't push node_modules on github because we already have package_lock.json and it contains all the packages with their version that are required for our project so to get node_modules then do `npm install`.
10. Note : Whenever the request is coming then it matches the route from the top so the order in which routes are defined mattered. Order of writing a route matters alot.
11. POST Request : For post requests, install the postman and make a workspace/collection and test the api call.
###### Diving Into APIs ######
12. Here Post API is sending json Data using the Postman to server but our server not able to read the json data. So here we require the middleware and it will convert the incoming json data into javascript object and store it in req.body(). (express.json() is the middleware).
13. app.use(<requesthandler()>) : This function runs on all the routes as we only pass the requesthandler and not the route.
14. findOneAndUpdate({_id:userId},update_object,optional_object): This method is used to update the API.

###### Sanitization and Validations on APIs #######
To check the validations in update request then pass {runValidators: true} in findByIdAndUpdate.
